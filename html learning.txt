Head and body of the HTML file is differnet
So the header references some stuff that is in the body of the file
I think the header is so you can setup items
h1 = header 1

Can do inline
garbage

everything at the top (this way)

Best way for presentation is seperate CSS sheets that go through HTML

Using VS code
