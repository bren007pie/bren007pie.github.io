Head and body of the HTML file is differnet
So the header references some stuff that is in the body of the file
I think the header is so you can setup items
h1 = header 1

Can do inline
garbage

everything at the top (this way)

Best way for presentation is seperate CSS sheets that go through HTML

Using VS code

- Programming Note: In VScode you can use Emmit in visual studio to do HTML tags:
	alt + click = multiple cursors before each word
	ctrl+shift+ â†’ = go over one word for each cursor
	ctrl + shift + p = command pallet
	Search Emmet wrap
	Enter "b" for bold, "i" for italics, "u" for underline
	"a[href=www.google.com]" = href at address
	"element[attr=value]" = in general for element and attribute
