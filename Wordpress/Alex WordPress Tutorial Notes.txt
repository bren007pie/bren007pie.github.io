Post Runes Series 2 with Will

the themes I have on my sites:
- PokeHexDex is using Adventurer (it has full site editing, a bit more of a time investment to learn and become familiar with, and if you're just looking for a basic site to have a portfolio/profile about yourself, this one may be overkill) - https://pokehexdex.wordpress.com/
- portfolio site is using Revelar - it is a lot simpler, doesn't have all the functionality but for me it's enough for a simple profile site - https://alexandercourt.wordpress.com/
- VQL is using Dyad 2 - it's also pretty basic, I liked it for the header images - https://virtualquidditch.wordpress.com/

But there are also tons of other themes that would also work just as well



Q) Pattern vs template?
	no theme edits, no layout changes
	Revelar 

- classic view better
- appearance > customize > homepage settings > static page > About me (set home page)
- Wordpress.com logo
- Single colour theme
- Headers = Josefin Sans, base font = railway
	Like titles all caps
- Menus: Primary > Menu, take pages to ed
	Can add pages on there
	Can drag around hirarch
- make primary menu (only place)
- CSS class, paid plans get CSS editor
	pay for CSS
- Content options = for blogs
	check off
- Widget = area with block of content applies across whole site
	 Widget areas = e.g.  widgets in footer for footer
- Can only embedd Google stuff
- Widget, auto adds to footer widgets
- everything published if make front page
- Appearence > Customze
- couple ways to edit:
	edit
	view > edit button
- Lines give the main things
- Can switch between HTML and visual editor
- Colours is way off to the side
	can add colours
- add with plus button
- Classic wordpress editor
- 6 dogs is a drag, pump up and down
- NO paid AI, Vic, Grammarly
- AI can write
- update, then wordpress logo
- Link to games in this format
- page icons take first thing
- Quick buttons to change groups of things

- copy paste content (formats)
